The minimum number of bins required for any

_trustworthy_ so as to minimally suffer from small-number
fluctuations.

    max_trustworthy_level(nelements; [trusting_cutoff])

Calculates the highest binning `level` that remains statistically
trustworthy according to the [`TRUSTING_CUTOFF`](@ref), ``t_c``. 

Given a number of elements in a data stream, ``N``, this quantity
is 

```math
\ell_{\rm max} = {\rm floor} \left[ \log_2 \left( \frac{N}{t_c} \right) \right].
```

@doc raw"""
    trustworthy_level(level; [trustworthy_cutoff = 64])

A binning `level` is said to be a `trustworthy_level` if the number of bins
it contains is greater than or equal to the `trustworthy_cutoff`. 

The number of _bins_ ``N_{\rm bin}`` in any binning `level` is related to 
the number of elements ``N`` and its binning `level` ``\ell \in \{0, 1, \dots \}`` by 

```math
N_{\rm bin} = \frac{N}{2^{\ell}}.
```

This means that, for a given `trustworthy_cutoff` of ``t_c``, then the maximum
number of `trustworthy_level`s present are 

```math
{\rm Total}(\ell) = 1 + {\rm floor} \left[ \log_2 \left( \frac{N}{t_c} \right) \right],
```

where the extra 1 comes from assuming the original data stream has more than ``t_c``
elements in it, making the ``\ell = 0`` `level` a `trustworthy_level`. 

!!! note 
    Basically this just means that the statistics we're showing are not
    susceptible to low-number effects. The ``log_2`` term is the calculated 
    using [`max_trustworthy_level`](@ref).

Compute the ``R_X`` quantity from the binning analysis. This quantity
starts at ``1`` for low binning `level`s, then gradually rises, until the 
bins become statistically uncorrelated at which point ``R_X`` should saturate.
Once saturated, the effective number of uncorrelated elements in a correlated 
data stream of size ``N`` is given in terms of ``R_X`` by ``N / R_X``.
