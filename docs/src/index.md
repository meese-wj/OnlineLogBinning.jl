Julia package to determine effective number of uncorrelated data points in a correlated data stream via an `O(log N)` online binning algorithm.

## `Accumulator` type hierarchy

We implement this with three nested `Accumulator` `struct`s: the outermost [`BinningAccumulator`](@ref), the middle-level [`LevelAccumulator`](@ref), and the innermost [`PairAccumulator`](@ref). The [`BinningAccumulator`](@ref) stores a `Vector` of [`LevelAccumulator`](@ref), each of which store their own [`PairAccumulator`](@ref).

!!! note 
    For more information, check out [OnlineLogBinning's `Accumulator` `structs`](@ref).

## Similar packages

1. [`BinningAnalysis.jl`](https://github.com/carstenbauer/BinningAnalysis.jl) for a very similar Julia package which served as an inspiration for this one. Our package does not have as broad of a scope as theirs.
    * One of the authors of [`BinningAnalysis.jl`](https://github.com/carstenbauer/BinningAnalysis.jl) also wrote Ref. [[4]](@ref) which gives a great introduction to the statistical analysis of Monte Carlo data.

1. [`OnlineStats.jl`](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.j) for many more online statistics and routines, most of which are beyond the scope of this package.
