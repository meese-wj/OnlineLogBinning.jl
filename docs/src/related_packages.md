1. [`BinningAnalysis.jl`](https://github.com/carstenbauer/BinningAnalysis.jl) for a very similar Julia package which served as an inspiration for this one. Our package does not have as broad of a scope as theirs.
    * One of the authors of [`BinningAnalysis.jl`](https://github.com/carstenbauer/BinningAnalysis.jl) also wrote Ref. [BauerThesis](@cite) which gives a great introduction to the statistical analysis of Monte Carlo data.
