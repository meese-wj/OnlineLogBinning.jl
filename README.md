Julia package to determine effective number of uncorrelated data points in a correlated data stream via an `O(log N)` online binning algorithm.

This package uses the online logarithmic binning algorithm discussed in Refs. [[1]](@ref) and [[2]](@ref), but uses the numerically stable _first-pass pairwise_ algorithm from Ref. [[3]](@ref) to update the mean and variance accumulators. Importantly, the binning analysis is _online_ in the sense that the whole data stream of size `O(N)` need not be stored. Instead, a much smaller data stream of size `O(log N)` needs to be. This makes properly assessing the correlated errors generated from Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations practical to update _on-the-fly_ [[4]](@ref).
